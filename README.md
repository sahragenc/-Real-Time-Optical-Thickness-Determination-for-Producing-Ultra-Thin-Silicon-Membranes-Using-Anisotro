# -Real-Time-Optical-Thickness-Determination-for-Producing-Ultra-Thin-Silicon-Membranes-Using-Anisotro
This code is used to extract and predict the thickness of the silicon membranes produced by wet etching in potassium hydroxide in support of the paper titled "Real-Time Optical Thickness Determination for Producing Ultra-Thin Silicon Membranes Using Anisotropic Potassium Hydroxide Etching"

This code is used to calculate the average intensity transmitted through thinned silicon membranes. After you run the code it will ask you to enter a pathway to an image that you would like to calculate average intensity. Then it will ask for the thickness of the silicon membrane that you entered the image path to. The information entered will be plotted using linear regression and every other data point you add will update the plot as well. After you are done adding initial data points, enter "done" and it will ask if you would want to add more images, if you say no it will ask if you would like to predict the thickness of a sample with the intensity calculated from a image you upload. The accuracy of the prediction depends on the range, amount and the quality of the data points you entered initially. If you would like to test the prediction function, an example json file is uploaded with the code if you save the code and json file in the same directory you can test the prediction function with the example data set.
